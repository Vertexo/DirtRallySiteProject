### Short annotation about this site:

This project emerged from my hobby - simracing (simulator/game - Dirt Rally)

The reason I made this leaderboards site is because as a competitive person I like statistics when it comes to sports or any other competition. Unfortunately there seems to be lack of statistics to determine drivers' skills or proficiency by visiting the official Dirt Rally website. There were no any ranks or leaderboards to determine the fastest or the most stable drivers by finished events. Or who has finished in first place, Top 10 or top 100 more times than any other competitor.

This site will scrap all completed events information from official site and upload it on the server.

I taught myself programming and web development by making this site. Some areas of the site may still be under development.

In upper right corner of the site you can see "Database active since: 07.27.2018". It is date, I started working on this site
and scraping official events data. So the oldest Daily and Daily 2 event on this site is from 07.27.2018.
